# Directory & File Descriptions

## data/ directory
The data/ directory holds the raw and processed data files, typically in formats like CSV, JSON, or Excel, organized into subfolders such as raw/, processed/, interim/, and external/. This structure helps manage data at different stages of transformation and ensures that raw data is preserved. It directly supports modeling, as processed data is fed into models for analysis. Separating data this way helps prevent accidental overwriting and provides a clear workflow for transforming data

## docs/ directory
The docs/ directory contains documentation files, usually written in Markdown (.md) like this file or reStructuredText (.rst). It provides essential context and instructions for the project, such as setup, usage, and project goals. Organized documentation helps keep the project accessible and understandable to others. This separation ensures that documentation remains distinct from the code and other project files, making it easier to navigate and maintain

## models/ directory
The models/ directory stores trained models, serialized model files, and model predictions. It is tied to the modeling component of the project, where models are trained and saved for later use. By separating models in their own directory, you can easily track model versions, manage their storage, and maintain consistency across different stages of the project

## notebooks/ directory
The notebooks/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and analysis. These notebooks are used to document the process of working with the data and training models. The separation of notebooks from other project components helps keep experiments organized, ensuring that all code is reproducible and easy to follow for future work or collaborations

## references/ directory
The references/ directory includes supplemental files such as data dictionaries, manuals, or research papers that provide context or background for the data and analysis. Keeping these references separate from the main code and data helps maintain clarity and makes it easier to access relevant information when needed

## reports/ directory
The reports/ directory stores generated reports (e.g., HTML, PDF, LaTeX) and figures that summarize the projectâ€™s findings. These files are typically the output of analysis and modeling, shared with stakeholders. By isolating reports and figures in a dedicated directory, you prevent cluttering the main project components while ensuring that results are well-organized and easy to locate

## test_correlation/
The testing_correlation/ directory contains the main project code, including configuration files, data processing scripts, and modeling scripts such as train.py and predict.py. It is the core part of the codebase, where the logic for processing data and running models resides. Organizing code in this manner helps maintain clarity, facilitates version control, and makes the project more scalable

## files

The files include essential project configuration files such as README.md, requirements.txt, setup.cfg, LICENSE, Makefile, and pyproject.toml. These files are crucial for setting up the project environment, managing dependencies, and ensuring reproducibility. Keeping them separate from the code and data helps maintain a clean structure, ensuring that the setup and configuration of the project are easy to manage

By separating each of these components into their own directories and files, you create a well-organized project structure that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to navigate, ensuring clarity and efficiency as the project evolves
